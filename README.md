What's It Like Outside?

This is a small single page website that is shown on an always-on iPod Touch
at my front door.  It is supposed to be a good reference for things to know
before leaving.  This is live at codemancer.com.


This contains code for tracking the next MIT Saferide Boston West shuttle and
when it stops at 58 Manchester street.  It also has the weather for the rest
of the day and the next day.  I didn't add in a clock since it's already stuck
at the top of the iPod Touch.  I tried to add in a tracker for the Boston T
Green Line but it isn't tracked in realtime so adding that information to Wilo
wouldn't be useful.

Future features are tracked in github issues.
