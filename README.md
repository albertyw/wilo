What's It Like Outside?

This is live at codemancer.com.  Currently, this contains code for tracking
the next MIT Saferide Boston West shuttle and when it stops at 58 Manchester
street and the weather for the rest of the day and the next day.  I tried to
add in a tracker for the T Green Line but it isn't tracked in realtime so
adding that information to Wilo wouldn't be useful.
